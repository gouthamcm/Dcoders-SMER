# Dcoders-SMER

We, the team Dcoders, are envisioning to build a next-generation Smart Electronic Medical record (EMR) system with integration to third-party laboratories and Medical stores. We believe that the Medical industry has to be made more convenient and effortless for the public. Therefore, these integrations can reduce unnecessary visits to hospitals and laboratories, which can be a source of hospital-acquired infections. Along with this, we provide a system using blockchain tech to analyse and prevent the supply of counterfeit medicines.

This type of EMR will be a pioneer in its market as it can run pluggable deep learning and machine learning models on various items, including CT Scans, ECG, x-rays, and many more. This EMR will also be intelligent enough to provide knowledgeable insights to the doctors and prescribe medicines based on their previous history. We are also implementing this EMR via decentralized technology, and every patient will be anonymous to the other users of the network. This private-user system helps us run algorithms on the medical data (without breach of privacy) to identify local outbreaks of diseases and alert respective authorities. One further innovation to our idea is the inclusion of family trees that can help doctors access not only your Medical history but also the data of your ancestors that helps in precision Medicine.
